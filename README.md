The object of study of this diploma thesis is the analysis of the most popular ship routing algorithms, regarding the optimization of routes as well as the creation of a model for the correct categorization of different types of ships using images. . Diploma proceeds to analyze the basic principles of Neural Networks as well as the analysis of Deep Learning networks culminating in the Xception model which is used to train a classification model. During the planning and implementation process of the categorization model, reference is made to the development environment and the basic libraries used. For the implementation of the project, the images will divided into training (train), validation (validation) and test data (test). In addition, the data augmentation process is applied for the purpose of augmentation model returns. For training the pre-trained is used Xception model.
Additionally we test to see if our model is responsive to a data set of random images, performing matching labels of ship categories in each image.
